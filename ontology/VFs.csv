This process of segmental gene conversion has the potential to tremendously amplify the capacity to generate antigenic variants but can be limited by structural constraints, as these assembled mosaics, unlike the whole donor alleles, have not been under long-term selection for structural fitness.	VF0520	Immune evasion; Antigenic variation; Adherence
Rvh T4SS		Anaplasma	Phagocytophilum	HZ	Similar to the virB/virD system of A. tumefaciens;The T4SS of Rickettsiales is characterized by an expansion of the virB4 and virB6 gene families and an absence of virB5. In addition, species in the family Anaplasmataceae have an expansion of virB2 and are missing virB1; The presence of multiple copies of T4SS components may facilitate environment- or host cell-dependent delivery of effector molecules		Secretes virulence factors that are responsible for subverting innate immunity and inhibiting host cell apoptosis	"Two effectors have been identified and partially characterized so far: the ankyrin repeat domaincontaining

AnkA is phosphorylated on tyrosine. AnkA protein translocates to the nucleus. AnkA binds to a broad range of targets, including ATC-rich sequences, and transcriptional regulatory regions of the CYBB locus, to suppress the host cell innate immune response;Ats-1 contains a mitochondria-targeting signal. It is imported into the mitochondria and induces host cell apoptosis; Ats-1 binds BECN1, a
protein critical for autophagy nucleation, and induces autophagosome formation."	VF0487	Secretion system; Type IV secretion system; Type IVa
ALO	Anthrolysin O	Bacillus	Anthracis			Belongs to cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC). CDCs are pore-forming toxins, which require cholesterol in the membrane to form pores with a mechanism not completely clarified; It is generally known that monomers oligomerize into a prepore complex and that this step is followed by a large conformational change in each oligomer, resulting in the insertion into the membrane	Lytic activity against phagocytes and decreases the barrier function of human polarized epithelial cells		VF0534	Toxin; Pore-forming toxin; <beta>-PFT
Anthrax toxin		Bacillus	Anthracis		AtxA, a pXO1 gene required for transcription of the three toxin genes, also positively regulated encapsulation; the expression of atxA gene is not controlled by CO2	Belongs to the family of bacterial AB toxins:; <spacer>composed of a single B subunit called protective antigen (PA) and two alternative A subunits: edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF); Monomeric PA displays four structural domains:; <spacer>Domain 1 contains the proteolytic activation site. Domain 2 is a <beta>-barrel core containing a large flexible loop for pore formation. Domain 3 is involved in heptamer formation. Domain 4 binds to anthrax toxin receptor (ATR); LF is organized into four domains:; <spacer>Domain 1 (LFn) is the PA-binding domain. Domain 2 (VIP2-like, VIP2, an ADP-ribosylating toxin from Bacillus cereus) participates in forming a binding pocket for substrate peptide. Domain 3 is a helical bundle that may contribute to substrate specificity by restricting access to the binding pocket. Domain 4 is the catalytic center;  PDB code for PA: 1ACC, LF: 1J7N, EF: 1K8T, 1K93, 1K90	The combination of PA and EF is edema toxin (EdTx), the combination of PA and LF is lethal toxin (LeTx); EF is a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that causes dramatic increases in intracellular concentrations of cAMP; LF is a zinc-dependent protease that cleaves mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) in their amino-terminal regions. It is a multi-functional virulence factor that appears to play a role in all stages of infection. Early in the infection, it acts to suppress immune cell and cytokine responses, thereby promoting bacterial outgrowth. Later in the disease, it induces the cytokine-independent shock-like death associated with anthrax.	PA, EF and LF are secreted independently and assemble at the mammalian cell surface into toxin complexes. PA binds to cell-surface anthrax toxin receptor (ATR), encoded by the tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) gene. ATR is a type I membrane protein with an extracelluar von Willebrand factor type A domain (VWA) and is cleaved by furin or a furin-like protease, releases a amino-terminal 20kDa fragment (PA20) and the receptor-bound carboxy-terminal 63kDa fragment (PA63). Recently, a second PA receptor encoded by capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2) has been identified. It has 60% amino acid identity to ATR/TEM8 within the VWA/I domain, as well as a conserved MIDAS (metal ion dependent adhesion site) motif; PA63 oligomerizes into ring-shaped hepameric or actameric pre-channels and binds 3 or 4 LF/EF substrates respectively. The assembled toxic complexes are then internalized by membrane lipid rafts and directed to endosomes. The PA oligomer transforms into a transmembrane, <beta>-barrel channel. The proton motive force unfolds and translocates LF and EF through the channel. Once the enzymatic moieties have accessed the cytosolic compartment, they exert their toxic activites.

HBL	Haemolysin BL	Bacillus	Cereus		"This enterotoxin is toxic only as a ternary complex. Neither any binary
combination of the components nor any individual component is toxic in its own right"	Tripartite toxin composed of three distinct protein components, B (41 kDa), L1 (38.2 kDa), and L2 (43.5 kDa); Hbl-B has a striking resemblance to HlyE/ClyA/SheA, a single-component hemolytic enterotoxin	A pore-forming toxin possesses hemolytic, cytotoxic, dermonecrotic, and vascular permeability activities	"HBL-B is the only protein able to associate productively with the cell membrane, and this binding is followed by the ordered recruitment of first L1
and then L2.The membrane-associated HBL components form a membrane attack complex that causes lysis by a colloid osmotic mechanism"	VF0532	Toxin; Pore-forming toxin; ClyA family PFT
InhA	Immune inhibitor A	Bacillus	Anthracis				A secreted and cell associated protease plays a role in anthrax virulence through cleavage of numerous host substrates including host proteins involved in the coagulation cascade so as to potentially facilitate circulatory dissemination of bacteria; a regulatory factor of adhesin BslA expression		VF0536	Enzyme; Metalloprotease

VF0533	Toxin; Pore-forming toxin; ClyA family PFT
BadA/Vomp	Bartonella adhesin A/variably expressed outer membrane proteins	Bartonella	Henselae	Houston-1	BadA of B. henselae and Vomps of B. quintana belong to the class of trimeric autotransporter adhesins, which also includes YadA of Yersinia enterocolitica, Hia and Hsf of Haemophilus influenzae, and UspA of Moraxella catarrhalis.	The 340-kDa BadA (monomer) consists of an N-terminal head region, a long, highly repetitive stalk, and a C-terminal membrane anchor.;the stalk of BadA is exclusively responsible for fibronectin binding.;the head domain seems to be of conserved length and high sequence identity, and be involved in most of BadA functional properties including autoagglutination, binding to extracellular matrix and host cells and triggering of proangiogenic host cell responses.	Non-fimbrial adhesins that mediate bacterial autoaggregation as well as adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin and collagens), resulting in cell adhesion and induction of a paracrine proangiogenic response: activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in infected host cells		VF0371	Adherence; Autotransporter
Flagella		Bartonella	Bacilliformis	KC583	B. bacilliformis is highly motile due to the expression of multiple unipolar flagella. It has been suggested that nonmotile variants bind poorly and do not invade erythrocytes. But B. henselae, B. quintana, and B. tribocorum are nonflagellated but capable of invading erythrocytes, flagella cannot be essential for the process of erythrocyte invasion in these species.		Mediate motility and enhance binding to erythrocytes; TLR5 evasion		VF0373	Motility
LPS		Bartonella	Henselae	Houston-1	The endotoxic activity of purified LPS from B. henselae was shown to be 1,000-10,000-fold lower than that of enterobacterial LPS.;Some of the structural features of B. henselae LPS are shared by the low-endotoxic LPS of other intracellular bacteria that cause chronic infections - penta-acylation of lipid A of Chlamydia trachomatis and the presence of a long-chain fatty acid in the lipid A of Legionella pneumophila.	A rare lipid A core structure (2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-glucose disaccharide bisphosphate), pentaacylation of lipid A, an uncommon long-chain fatty acid (25-hydroxyhexacosanoic or 27-hydroxy octacosanoic acid) and a short carbohydrate region (glucose attached to 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid disaccharide)	Low endotoxic potency of the LPS could be a prerequisite for chronic interaction with endothelial cells		VF0370	Low endotoxicity
Trw type IV secretion system		Bartonella	Henselae	Houston-1	The Trw system of Bartonella, probably acquired from horizontal gene transfer, shares an extensive homology with the Trw system of the Trw conjugation machinery of the broad-host-range antibiotic-resistance plasmid R388.;The trw genes of Bartonella are collinear with the respective genes of plasmid R388, except for the presence of multiple tandem gene duplications of trwL and trwJIH in Bartonella.; The trwL (the homologue of the pilin virB2) and trwJ (the homologues of the minor pilus-associated component virB5) sequences are highly variable within the same Bartonella species, as well as between different species.But the various copies of trwH and trwI are almost identical.; A remarkable difference between Trw systems of plasmid R388 and of Bartonella is the lack of the T4CP-encoding trwB gene in Bartonella.		Required for colonization of erythrocytes and/or for intraerythrocytic replication.; Trw mediates host-specific erythrocyte infection. Surface-located TrwL and TrwJ might represent the T4SS components that determine host-specificity of erythrocyte parasitism,;No substrate transported by the Bartonella Trw system has been identified.	The role of the Trw system might primarily be the formation of pili. The large number of genes that encode variant forms of the two pilus subunits might allow bacteria to synthesize particularly long pili and/or highly variable pili that might allow the interaction with different host-cell-surface structures (for example, different blood-group antigens on the erythrocyte surface), or could represent a general mechanism of immune evasion by antigenic variation.	VF0372	Secretion system; Type IV secretion system; Adherence
VirB/VirD4 type IV secretion system		Bartonella	Henselae	Houston-1	The VirB/VirD4 T4SS is well conserved within the genus Bartonella, although it is absent in B. bacilliformis. Its closest relative is a genuine conjugation system, the AvhB/TraG system of the cryptic plasmid pATC58 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens; The Bartonella VirB/VirD4 system is encoded by an operon of 10 genes (virB2-virB11). Seven Bartonella-translocated effector proteins (BepA-BepG) and the coupling protein VirD4 are encoded within 22 kb downstream of the virB operon. The entire virB/virD4/bep region probably constitutes a pathogenicity island	The Bartonella VirB/VirD4 system is considered to encompass a VirB2 pilin and VirB5 minor pilus component, which form a pilus that can mediate contact with host cells. The components VirB3, VirB4 and VirB6-VirB11, which form a pore complex that spans both Gram-negative membranes and possibly also the host-cell membrane. And the T4SS coupling protein (T4CP) VirD4, an inner-membrane protein thought to function as an interface between the pore complex and the T4SS substrates	Crucial for establishment of infection in the primary niche- the endothelial cells, required for colonization of endothelial cells, by mediating the intracellular delivery of effector proteins (BepA-BepG). Translocation of the Beps provokes distinct cellular phenotypes: (i) a massive cytoskeleton rearrangement, resulting in the engulfment of bacterial aggregates (a phenotype called 'invasome' formation), (ii) NF-<kappa>B-dependent proinflammatory activation, characterized by chemokine secretion and expression of cell adhesion proteins, and (iii) enhanced cell survival as a result of anti-apoptosis (iv) capillary-like sprout formation of endothelial cell aggregates,	The Bartonella-translocated effector protein (BepA-BepG) are required for invasion, proinflammatory activation and antiapoptotic protection of endothelial cells. The C terminus of each Bep harbours at least one copy of the novel Bep intracellular delivery (BID) domain and a short, positively charged tail sequence. The bipartite C terminus is required for protein transfer, their N-terminal region might be crucial for effector function within host cells.; The N termini of BepA-BepC comprise the Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) domain, which is conserved in many bacteria and was proposed to be involved in bacterial cell division. The effector functions of the Fic domain within mammalian target cells are unknown.; The N termini of BepD-BepF contain short repeated peptide sequences that contain conserved putative tyrosine-phosphorylation motifs (EPLYA). Future studies might show how tyrosine-phosphorylated Beps contribute to the subversion of endothelial-cell function. BepG is unique among the Beps because it appears to be entirely composed of BID domains.; Invasome formation can be triggered in a redundant manner, either by BepG alone or by the combined action of effectors BepC and BepF.

It can also donate the phosphoryl group to water to form inorganic phosphate, thereby completely halting the activation of BvgA ; the transcriptional activator, BvgA consists of two domains: receiver domain with the phosphorylated site Asp-54, the C-terminal domain containing HTH motif, which facilitates specific DNA sequence binding at the promoters of bvg-activated genes	Positively regulate virulence genes by binding to promoter sequences, negatively regulate virulence repressed genes (vrgs) via BvgR; mediate transition between infectious (Bvg+) and non-infectious (Bvg-) phase; regulating biofilm formation		VF0336	Regulation; Two-component system
Cya	Invasive Adenylate cyclase /haemolysin	Bordetella	Pertussis	Tohama I	Originally identified as a hemolysin because it will lyse red blood cells; secreted by type I pathway and secretion requires CyaB, D, E proteins	1706 residues-long protein, calmodulin-activated adenylate cyclase catalytic activity is located within the N-terminal 400 amino acids. The remaining 1306aa C-terminal cell binding domain, homologous to the Repeats-in-Toxin (RTX) family of calcium-binding, pore-forming bacterial protein toxins, mediates delivery of the catalytic domain into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The latter consists itself of three functional domains typical for RTX hemolysins.

S2, S3, S4 and S5 comprise the B oligomer, responsible for binding the toxin to the cell surface. Each subunit is translated separately with an amino-terminal signal sequence which is cleaved during transport to the periplasm.

TTSS	Type III secretion system	Bordetella	Pertussis	Tohama I	B. pertussis has genes that could encode a TTSS, but they seem not to be expressed.

Like their Brucella counterpart, the S. meliloti ChvI/ExoS and A. tumefaciens ChvI/ChvG two component regulatory systems also regulate genes involved in modulating cell envelope properties (outer membrane protein composition and lipid A modifications), but, more importantly, the genes that comprise the ChvI/ExoS and ChvI/ChvG regulons are essential for the establishment and maintenance of the symbiotic state of S. meliloti with its plant host and disease production by A. tumefaciens in its plant host.		Controls the expression of genes involved with the maintenance of cell envelope integrity. These genes encode multiple members of the Omp3 family of proteins (Omp25 (also named Omp3a), Omp22 or Omp3b) as well as gene products that modify the fatty acid composition of the lipid A moiety of the LPS; controls the expression of the T4SS VirB		VF0368	Regulation; Two-component system
C<beta>G	Cyclic <beta>-1,2 glucan	Brucella	Melitensis	16M	Cyclic <beta>-1,2-glucan synthase (Cgs), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of cyclic <beta>-1,2-glucans, is a 320-kDa  polytopic integral inner membrane protein with six transmembrane-spanning segments		 Brucella cyclic <beta>-1,2-glucan could interfere with the maturation of the bacterial vacuole by disrupting cholesterol-rich lipid rafts present on phagosomal membranes  and consequently prevent the Brucella containing vacuole (BCV) to fusion with lysosomes, and allowing Brucella to reach an endoplasmic reticulum-derived vacuole permissive for bacterial replication	Periplasmic homopolysaccharides that is structurally similar to cyclodextrins and is capable of extracting cholesterol from cellular membrane.	VF0366	Intracellular survival
LPS	Lipopolysaccharide	Brucella	Melitensis	16M	Brucella possesses a non-classical LPS as compared with the so-called classical LPS from enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli. B. abortus lipid A possesses a diaminoglucose backbone (rather than glucosamine), and acyl groups are longer (C28 rather than C12 and C16) and are only linked to the core by amide bounds (rather than ester and amide bonds).; In contrast to enterobacterial LPSs, Brucella LPS is several-hundred-times less active and toxic than E. coli LPS.; this is an evolutionary adaptation to an intracellular lifestyle, low endotoxic activity is shared by other intracellular pathogens such as Bartonella and Legionella.		Plays a role in entry and early survival inside macrophages;Resistance to innate-immunity anti-bacterial responses;a modulator of the immune response	The entry and early survival stages of smooth Brucella are lipid-raft-dependent. The entry-gateway seems to include Brucella surface-exposed HSP60-PrPc (cellular prion protein) interaction but also a SR-A (class A scavenger)-lipid-A interaction  and is also dependent on the LPS O-chain. And the LPS O-chain ensures the Brucella containing vacuole (BCV) aviodance of fusion with lysosomes transiently; The chemical structure of Brucella LPS permits the bacteria to become highly resistant to anti-bacterial effectors of the innate immune system. Long O-chains at the bacterial surface should provoke a steric hindrance leading to the formation of a protecting barrier. The presence of long O-chains at the surface of Brucella  prevents the deposition of complement at the bacterial surface. The O-chains also could prevent a specific recognition of the Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and as a consequence impair expression of any cytokines or iNOS, both of which are known to be involved in the clearance of intracellular Brucella. The low number of anionic groups in the core lipid A, especially charged phosphate groups could both remove anionic targets and facilitate a tighter aggregation of LPS molecules via their hydrophobic fatty acids, leading to less binding and penetration of antibacterial cationic peptides.;The Brucella LPS forms stable large clusters with MHC-II named macrodomians in the cell surface, interfering with MHC-II presentation of peptides to specific CD4+ T cells.

Brucella initiates interactions with Sar1/COPII-dependent ERES (ER exit sites), the early secretory pathway. Unlike Legionella, that intercepts COPI-dependent vesicular trafficking from the ER for the biogenesis of its ER-derived replicative organelle; The acidified Brucellacontaining vacuole (BCV) interacts with late endosome/lysosomes, acquiring markers such as LAMP-1, CD63 and Rab7. Subsequently, wild-type Brucella is able to exclude these late endosomal/lysosomal markers from its vacuole and acquire markers of the endoplasmic reticulum. The replicative organelle contains not only the ER marker calreticulin, but also two proteins, Rab2 and GAPDH, that regulate membrane traffic between the ER and Vesicular Tubular Compartments (VTC), a compartment in the secretory pathway between ER and Golgi in which proteins are sorted either to an anterograde pathway to the Golgi, or for recycling to the ER. These components of the BCV are critical for the ability of Brucella to replicate intracellularly; VceA and VceC, also regulated by VjbR, are novel effectors, both requrie intact C termini for translocation through the VirB system	VF0365	Secretion system; Type IV secretion system; Intracellular survival and replication

B. pseudomallei encodes three luxI homologs that produce as many as seven quorum-sensing molecules, including C8-HSL (N-octanoyl-L-Homoserine lactone), 3-hydroxy-C8-HSL, 3-oxo-C8-HSL, C10-HSL, 3-hydroxy-C10-HSL, 3-oxo-C10-HSL, 3-hydroxy-C12-HSL, and 3-oxo-C14-HSL. It also has five luxR homologs to sense these signals.;The LuxIR system consists of the AHL (N-acyl-homoserine lactone) synthase LuxI, and the transcriptional regulator LuxR. When a critical cell population density has been attained, quorum-sensing molecules bind to the receptor protein LuxR, then induces or represses target genes involved in diverse functions. LuxR was shown to tightly control expression of luxI, likely through binding to a lux box-like sequence that partially overlaps the -35 region of the putative luxI.

TTSS	Type III secretion system	Chlamydia	Trachomatis		Type III secretion genes of Proteobacteria are usually tightly clustered in a pathogenicity island or on a plasmid, suggesting that they can be horizontally transferred as a unit. But chlamydial type III secretion loci are dispersed in at least three different chromosomal locations; The G+C contents of these loci, are similar to the overall G+C content of the genome, suggesting that the type III system has been present in chlamydiae for a long time and has been essential to their parasitic lifestyle. On the basis of this loose retainment of operon organization and the significant divergence from other type III systems, it has been postulated an ancient acquisition of the type III system by chlamydiae		Translocating different effectors into the host cell, depending on the phase of the developmental cycle	"Chlamydial TTS effectors include translocated actin-recruiting phosphoprotein (Tarp), Ser/Thr protein kinase (Pkn5), negative regulator of TTS (CopN), inclusion membrane proteins IncA, IncB and IncC. The Tir-like effector protein Tarp might function as a receptor for an unidentified chlamydial intimin analog and mediate the recruitment of actin to the C. trachomatis inclusion. Tarp is activated upon tyrosine phosphorylation by an unidentfied eukaryotic kinase. The existence of a Src consensus motif in Tarp strongly supports the hypothesis that it is phosphorylated by a Src kinase. CopN is a homolog of the Yersinia TTs regulator YopN. CopN might be involved in both T3S downregulation and physical shutoff of the injectsome as reticulate body (RB) start differentiating into intermediate body (IB). ; The predicted lipoprotein, CdsJ, is predicted to span the periplasmic space and associate with integral membrane proteins CdsR-V. CdsJ also probably interacts with the inner-membrane protein CdsD, which has also been detected at the surface of C. trachomatis EBs. The highly conserved N terminus of CdsV displays seven predicted transmembrane domains, while the large C-terminal region is less conserved, more hydrophilic and is predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm where it might interact with effector proteins, chaperones or other TTS apparatus proteins. The outermembrane ring of the injectisome, which is necessary for the TTS needle to cross the outer membrane, is composed of CdsC, a homolog of YscC of Yersinia. ;The Chlamydia outer protein CopB and its paralog CopB2 of C. trachomatis are homologs of the Yersinia T3S translocator protein YopB and, as such, are predicted to function

Two-domains: the N-terminal domain composed of <alpha>-helices and the C terminal domain consisting mainly of <beta>-sheet;PDB code:1CA1	Alpha-toxin is a secreted zinc-metalloenzyme possessing lethal, hemolytic, and dermonecrotic activities and phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase activities, and is a major pathogenic factor in the development of gas gangrene;At low doses it causes limited phospholipid hydrolysis, which in turn activates diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide-mediated signal transduction pathways		VF0378	Toxin; Zinc-metallophospholipase C
alpha-toxin (novyi)		Clostridium	Novyi	NT	Belongs to the family of large clostridial cytotoxins which act on cells through the modification of small GTP-binding proteins. The family includes toxin A and B from C. difficile, the hemorrhagic and lethal toxin from C. sordellii, and the <alpha>-toxin from C. novyi.; Unlike C. difficile toxins A and B and the variant toxin B recruit the nucleotide sugar UDP-glucose as cosubstrate, <alpha>-toxin uses UDP-GlcNAc as a cosubstrate. <alpha>-Toxin also utilizes UDP-glucose, but the Km is about 340 uM compared to 17 uM for UDP-glucNAc.		Like  C. difficile toxins A and B, the Clostridium sordellii hemorrhagic toxin, and the <alpha>-toxin from C. novyi selectively glucosylate Rho subfamily GTPases but not GTPases from other subfamilies. <alpha>-toxins modify the highly conserved threonine 37 residue in RhoA (Thr35 of Rac or Cdc42) located in the switch 1 region of these GTPases. Mono-O glucosylation of this threonine residue has important functional consequences. First, it inhibits activation of Rho proteins by GEFs. Second, glucosylation of Rho proteins increases membrane binding. Third, it inhibits the interaction of GTPases with their effectors. Therefore, glucosylation of Rho GTPases block Rho-dependent signaling pathways.		VF0386	Toxin; Intracellular toxin; Glucosyltransferase
alpha-toxin (septicum)		Clostridium	Septicum		Secreted via type II secretion pathway;secreted as inactive protoxin monomers that bind to GPI-anchored proteins on the target cell.

BoNT	Botulinum neurotoxin	Clostridium	Botulinum	Hall A	BoNTs are the most toxic proteins known.; Seven immunologically distinct forms of BoNT exist, designated as serotypes A to G.; BoNTs associate with non-toxic clostridial proteins to form large, stable complexes that exist in cultures known as progenitor toxins. These progenitor toxins comprise three different forms: 12S (C 300 kDa), 16S (C 500 kDa), and 19S (C 900 kDa), and consist of neurotoxin subunits coupled with one or more non-toxic components known as neurotoxin associated proteins (NAPs). NAPs possess hemagglutinin activity (HA) protect the neurotoxin from harsh environment inside host like lowpH and proteases, and include HA-17, HA-22, HA-33, and HA-55.	BoNT is initially synthesized as a 150 kDa single-chain protein that is post-translationally nicked to form a dichain structure. The nicked neurotoxin consists of a 100 kDa heavy chain and a 50 kDa light chain (Zinc metalloprotease) linked by a disulfide bridge. The crystal structure of BoNT indicates that the heavy chain consists of a receptor binding domain (HC) and a translocation domain (HN), while the light chain contains a catalytic domain (LC).; PDB code: 3BTA, 1EPW	BoNTs are metalloproteinases that enter peripheral cholinergic nerve terminals, where they cleave one or two of the three core proteins of the neuroexocytosis apparatus and elicit persistent but reversible inhibition of neurotransmitter release.; BoNT also serves as a remarkably effective treatment for involuntary muscle disorders such as blepharospasm, strabismus, hemifacial spasm, certain types of spasticity in children, and other ailments.	The BoNT mechanism of action consists of four sequential steps:;<spacer>I. rapid and specific binding to the cholinergic nerve terminal membrane;<spacer>II. internalization inside a vesicle endowed with an ATPase proton pump; <spacer>III. membrane translocation triggered by acidification of the vesicular lumen, which causes a structural rearrangement with membrane insertion of the toxin and translocation of the L-chain into the cytosol; <spacer>IV. expression of the L-chain proteolytic activity against specific substrates.; Receptors for BoNTs are composed of both gangliosides that bind toxins with low affinity and protein receptors that form high-affinity complexes with toxins. Synaptotagmins I and II, two homologous synaptic vesicle proteins, have been shown to function in conjunction with gangliosides to mediate entry of BoNT/B into cells. Low-affinity interactions between BoNT/A and gangliosides have also been reported. Recent studies have indicated that the synaptic vesicle protein SV2 acts as the protein receptor for BoNT/A.; BoNT light chains were identified as having zinc-dependent protease activity and to specifically target a group of proteins known as SNAREs.;The L-chains of the seven BoNTs are remarkably specific proteases:;<spacer> BoNT/B, /D, /F and /G cleave only synaptic vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) at single sites, which results in VAMP losing most of its cytosolic domain.;<spacer>BoNT/A and /E cleave only 25 kDa synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP-25) at single individual sites within its C-teminus.;<spacer> BoNT/C cleaves both SNAP-25 and syntaxin.

C2 toxin		Clostridium	Botulinum		C2 toxin consists of the enzyme component C2I, and the separated binding/translocation component C2II. C2II shares sequence similarity with the protective antigen PA from anthrax toxin	C2II can be divided into 4 domains. The C-terminal domain IV of C2II, which is responsible for receptor binding, has no sequence similarity with PA. Proteolytic activation of C2II occursat residue 182.; C2I consists of two domains (residues 1-225 and 226-431). Whereasthe N-terminal domain functions as an adaptor for docking to the binding component C2II, the C-terminal part is the ADP ribosyltransferase domain.; PDB code: 2J3Z, 2J42	Inhibition of actin polymerization and destruction of the actin cytoskeleton.	Proteolytically activated C2II by trypsin between K181 and A182 forms heptamers and binds to a carbohydrate cell surface receptor. After attachment of C2I, the toxin complex is endocytosed to reach early endosomes. At low pH of endosomes, C2II-heptamers insert into the membrane, form pores and deliver C2I into the cytosol. Here, C2I ADP-ribosylates actin at Arg177 to block actin polymerization and to induce depolymerization of actin filaments.; C2 toxin exclusively mono-ADP-ribosylates at Arg177 the isoforms of <alpha>/<beta>-nonmuscle, as well as <gamma>-smooth muscle, G-actin.

(e.g. B. cereus VIP, C. perfringens iota-toxin, C. botulinum C2 toxin, C. spiroforme toxin, and C. difficile toxin.); The binary iota toxin is produced exclusively by C. perfringens type E strains.;The two proteins that comprise iota toxin were designated iota a or Ia (slower moving) and iota b or Ib (faster moving), based on electrophoretic mobility in crossed immunoelectrophoresis.; iota toxin requires proteolytic activation. The proteolytic activation of Ib precursor into Ib occurs at A211, which then facilitates Ia docking, formation of voltage-dependent ion-permeable channels in membranes, and formation of heptamers on cell membrane. Ia is also proteolytically activated by proteases, with a resultant loss of 9 to 13 amino acids from the N terminus. Proteolytic activation of Ia is unique among the 'A' components from binary toxins	PDB code: 1GIR, 1GIQ	Ia ADP-ribosylates skeletal muscle <alpha>-actin and nonmuscle <beta>/<gamma>-actin, and Ib binds to LSR, forming oligomers to create ion-permeable channels.

kappa-toxin		Clostridium	Perfringens	13	Clostridial collagenases include C. perfringens ColA, C. histolyticum ColG and ColH.	Clostridial collagenases consist of three different segments. Segment 1 represents the catalytic domain containing the consensus motif for zinc proteases, HEXXH. Segment 2 is thought to be a spacing domain of unknown function. Segment 3 is the collagen binding domain. Collagen-binding domains are known to bind various types of collagen. The mode of binding is specific recognition of triple-helical conformation of collagen, not a nonspecific hydrophobic interaction.

TcdA	Toxin A	Clostridium	Difficile	630	The toxin genes tcdA and tcdB are situated on the C. difficile chromosome in a 19.6-kilobase (kb) pathogenicity locus (PaLoc), along with the three accessory genes tcdC, tcdR and tcdE.;TcdA and TcdB are homologous to each other, to TcsH and TcsL of C. sordellii and to Tcn<alpha> of C. novyi. Because of their sequence homology, similar domain structure and glycosyltransferase properties these toxins are designated 'large clostridial cytotoxins'.	The catalytic domain and the receptor binding domain are located at the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively. The hydrophobic region in the middle part of the toxin molecule is proposed to be involved in translocation of the proteins across cellular membranes.;The C-terminal receptor-binding domain, is characterized by small repetitive sequence motifs, also called CROPS, clostridial repetitive oligopeptides. They consist of 20 to 50 amino acids and are repeated 14-30 times. The whole repetitive region of toxin A is needed for binding and endocytosis.; PDB code: 2G7C	Transfer the glucose moiety from UDP-glucose to members of the Rho family of small GTPase	"It is suggested that a carbohydrate structure (containing at least Gal<beta>1-4GlcN) is the essential element for binding of toxin A to its cell receptor, whether this carbohydrate is linked to proteins or lipids is unknown.;TcdA and TcdB modify Rho A, B, and C at threonine-37 and Rac, Cdc42, or Ras at the corresponding position threonine-35. Rho is preferentially modified in its inactive, GDP-bound state, in which threonine-37 is directed toward the solvent. In the GTP-bound state, threonine-37 participates in Mg2+ and nucleotide binding and appears to be less accessible for glucosylating clostridial toxins.; Toxin-induced glucosylation of Rho/Ras proteins causes dramatic morphological changes in eukaryotic cells. A dramatic redistribution of the actin cytoskeleton takes place.; Toxin-induced fluid response and diarrhea may be explained by tissue damage and inhibition of the barrier function of the enterocytes. They decrease transepithelial resistance, increase paracellular bacterial migration, and change the morphological features of tight junctions and associated proteins.; Both toxin A and toxin B have an
important role in C. difficile infection.TcdA and TcdB induce a pathological feature in the gut that may be summarized as a major inflammatory response."	VF0376	Toxin; Intracellular toxin; Glucosyltransferase
TcdB	Toxin B	Clostridium	Difficile	630	Many forms of variant toxin B have been identified, which are functional chimeras of toxin B (reference strain VPI 10463) and C. sordellii lethal toxin, e.g., C. difficile toxin B from strain 1470 and strain 8864. Their substrate specificities resemble that of lethal toxin. C. difficile strain C34 produces a toxin B variant modifying Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 as well as R-Ras, Ral, and Rap.	Toxin B includes three functional domains. ;<spacer>I: The receptor-binding domain is composed of repetitive oligopeptide elements commonly accepted as the motif for binding to carbohydrate structures of the receptor. ;<spacer>II: A hydrophobic region in the middle part of the molecule is supposed to form a transmembrane domain, allowing the catalytic domain to translocate into the cytoplasm. ;<spacer>III: The catalytic domain residing in the N terminal part possesses monoglucosyltransferase activity to modify the Rho-GTPases.;The first 546 residues of the N-terminus are the minimum size. The tryptophan-102 (W) and the DXD motif (residues 286-288) are involved in UDP-glucose cosubstrate binding through Mn2+ or Mg2+.The C-terminal part (residues 408-468) of the catalytic domain covers the protein substrate recognition site.; TcdB exhibits a higher rate of enzymatic activity than TcdA, leading to a quickened rate of cytopathic effects in some cell types.; PDB code: 2BVL, 2BVM	Transfer the glucose moiety from UDP-glucose to members of the Rho family of small GTPase	On binding to host cell receptors (The receptor for TcdB is undefined), the toxins are endocytosed. The low pH in endosomes triggers the first conformational change of the toxin leading to pore formation of the ligand translocation domain. Cytosolic inositolphosphates InsPx interacts with TcdB and induces second conformational change, activating the intrinsic protease function. The catalytic-DXD domain is released into cytosol. This is the first report on a bacterial toxin that uses eukaryotic signals for induced autoproteolysis to deliver its toxic domain into the cytosol of target cells.

TeNT	Tetanus neurotoxin	Clostridium	Tetani	E88	BoNTs and TeNT share ~35% sequence identity. The BoNT catalytic LC domains share up to 36% sequence identity, and the LC domains of BoNT/B and TeNT have over 50% identity.	TeNT is also structurally organized into heavy and light chains linked by a disulphide bond. The N-terminal L chain contains zinc endopeptidase activity, the HN domain of H chain is involved in escape of the toxin from endocytotic vesicles, and the HC domain of H chain is involved in binding to cellular receptors.;Structural analysis of HC, also termed fragment C, complexed with synthetic ganglioside reveals two distinct ganglioside binding sites on HC, termed the 'Gal4-GalNAc3', and 'sialic acid' binding sites.;  PDB code:1YVG,1AF9,1D0H	TeNT is a neurospecific toxin that binds to motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction, where it is internalized and undergoes axonal retrograde transport to the cell body. It is then secreted and taken up by adjacent inhibitory interneurons, where it blocks neurotransmitter release by cleaving VAMP/synaptobrevin.	The TeNT receptor complex has been shown to comprise ganglioside of G1b series and a protein receptor: synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2A, SV2B). The binding takes place within selected regions of the plasmamembrane that are enriched in cholesterol, gangliosides and glycophosphoinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins.; The action of BoNTs is mainly restricted to the neuromuscular junction, where they cause a long-lasting blockade of acetylcholine release. Unlike BoNTs, once internalized, TeNT undergoes retrograde axonal transport to the central nervous system, transcytosing across the synapse to internalize into the interneurons that regulate motorneuron activity. The spastic paralysis that results from intoxication with TeNT arises from the loss of spinal inhibitory control of motorneuron activity.; Like BoNT/B, BoNT/D, BoNT/F, and BoNT/G, synaptobrevin/VAMP2 is the substrate of TeNT.

The structure of the PFO monomer is rich in <beta>-sheet and can be divided into four distinct contiguous domains.; PDB code: 1PFO	Cytotoxin secreted as a soluble monomer, forms large homo-oligomeric aqueous pore complexes comprising up to 50 PFO molecules in cholesterol-containing membranes.	Soluble monomers of PFO bind to cholesterol-rich lipid membranes through hydrophobic loops at the tip of domain 4. Next, PFO monomers oligomerize on the membrane, ultimately forming pre-pore rings. Then, domain 3 <alpha>-helices pass through a disordered state and rearrange to form 2 <beta>-hairpins per monomer. Finally, the prepore to pore transition occurs through cooperative interactions, where the <beta>-hairpins form an extended <beta>-sheet that inserts into the membrane as a transmembrane <beta>-barrel.

Then DT is taken into the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. It reaches the cytoplasm by penetrating through the membrane in the early endosome. The catalytic fragment of DT is released into the cytoplasm and catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of eEF2, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis; DT toxin catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to the N3 atom of the diphthamide imidazole ring in eEF2 and has evolved a specific mechanism for inactivating the eukaryotic protein synthetic machinery without affecting the couterpart elongation factor G that is present in the bacterial pathogens that produce the offending toxins;DT has shown intrinsic nuclease activity by degrading double-stranded DNA without apparent specificity for nucleotide sequence	VF0363	Toxin; Intracellular toxin; ADP-ribosyltransferase; A-B type
Pili		Corynebacterium	Diphtheriae	NCTA 13129	The presence of pili has been for many years the hallmark of Gram-negative bacteria. However, in several Gram-positive microorganisms, fimbrial structures have been described.; In C. diphtheriae, the pili are generated by the sortase machinery. The sortase-mediated export of pilin subunits seems to exist in other pathogenic species such as Clostridium perfringens, Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.;Sortase is a cysteine transpeptidase conserved in all Gram-positive bacterial genomes. Sortase cleaves pilin precursors at the conserved LPXTG motif between threonine and glycine and tethers the threonine carboxyl group of the precursor protein to the amino group of cell wall cross-bridges within the lipid II precursor, or to the amino group of the conserved pilin motif within the surface protein precursor. The latter reaction leads to the formation of pilus fibres on the bacterial surface.	C. diphtheriae assembles on its surface three distinct pilus structures, designated as SpaA-, SpaD- and SpaH-type pili (Spa for sortase-meidated pilus assembly);All three pilus types have similar components, a major pilin subunit and two minor pilus proteins.

LOS		Haemophilus	Influenzae	Rd KW20	Lic1A (phosphorylcholine (ChoP) kinase) 5'-CAAT-3' within the 5'-end of its coding sequence; lic2A, also referred to as lexA, variation in the number of 5'-CAAT-3' repeats has been shown to correlate directly with phase variation of the Gal-<alpha>(1-4)<beta>-Gal LPS structure; But lgtC (glycosyltransferase), another phase-variable gene, ultimately dictates whether this structure is synthesized. lic3A encode a sialyl transferase which directs the substitution of LPS with sialic acid.	Comprising Lipid A, an inner core of one molecule 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Kdo) and three molecules of heptose, and an outer core composed of a heteropolymer of the neutral sugars glucose and galactose. Substitution of the out core with phosphorylcholine or sialic acid results in the heterogeneity of LPS; Lack O-antigen	Major immunogen; LOS phosphorylcholine (ChoP) may influence invasion via interaction with PAF receptor and stimulates of inflammotory signals; LPS phase variation is characterized by the spontaneous loss and gain of oligosaccharide structures present in the outer core. the phase variable expression of LPS biosynthesis genes promotes evasion of antigen-specific host immune defences and allow colonization of different host microenvironments	Lic1(lic1A-lic1D) responsible for the addition of phosphorylcholine to LPS. lic1A mediates phase variation (tetranucleotide repeat region); phase-variable gene lic3A encodes an <alpha>-2,3-sialyltransferase that is responsible for the addition of Neu5Ac to terminal lactose in the LPS, LPS sialylation has been shown to be important for resistance to the killing effectors of normal human serum	VF0044	Endotoxin

BabA	Blood group antigen binding adhesin	Helicobacter	Pylori	J99	Two alleles: babA2 gene encodes the complete adhesin, whereas babA1 is defective due to the  presence of a 10 bp repeat motif which results in the elimination of the start codon and the lack of Leb antigen-binding activity; babA2-genopositive H. pylori usually coexists with other disease-related H. pylori virulence-factor genes, such as vacA s1 and cagA			Binds to H, Lewis b antigen, and related ABO antigens.

CagA	Cytotoxin-associated antigen	Helicobacter	Pylori	26695		Characterized by amino acid sequence polymorphism, primarily depending on the duplicaiton of various numbers of a 34-amino-acid sequence located at the C-terminal region of the protein;Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala(EPIYA) motifs present in the C-terminal half of CagA is the tyrosine phosphorylation site.		CagA injected by type IV secretion system into gastric epithelial cells and subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinase. The phosphorylated CagA specifically binds SHP-2 (Src homology 2 domain containing protein) phosphatase, activates the phosphatase activity, which, in turn might be responsible for dephosphorylation of several cellular proteins; CagA interacts with hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) receptor, c-MET. This interaction leads to deregulation of the motogenic response; Non-phosphorylated CagA binds directly to Grb2 by its EPIYA motifs, and this interaction activates the stress-kinase pathway, resulting in the scatter phenotype; Non-phosphorylated CagA associates with the epithelial tight-junction scaffolding protein, ZO-1, and the transmembrane protein junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) to induce the formation of an aberrant apical junction protein complex, which results in the loss of cell polarity, proliferation and differentiation.;CagA specifically interacts with PAR1 (partitioning-defective 1)/MARK (microtubule affinity-regulating kinase) kinase to disorganize gastric mucosal architecture underlying tissue damage and inflammation in vivo. Because normal epithelial architecture constrains cell proliferation, its disorganization by CagA may liberate cells from growth-inhibitory cues and thereby promote gastric carcinogenesis in conjunction with the phosphorylation dependent CagA activities.; H. pylori disrupts the polarity of epithelial cells to use the apical cell surface as a replicative niche. CagA's ability to disrupt host cell polarity is a key fator in enabling colonization of the apical cell surface by H. pylori.	VF0059	Type IV secretory protein
Flagella		Helicobacter	Pylori	26695	H. pylori typically produce 4-6 unipolar flagella, which are encased in a membranous sheath and capped by terminal bulbs	Comprised of three main components (filament, hook and basal body). The flagellar filament is composed primarily of repeating subunits of two polypeptides: FlaA (the major component) and FlaB (a minor component). The flagellar hook is comprised primarily of FlgE. The basal body is a multiprotein structure that serves as the proton motive force-driven motor that propels rotation.	Confers motility, allows the bacteria to penetrate and colonize the gastric mucus layer. The lumenal pH of the fasting human stomach is <2, but with the gastric mucus there is a pH gradient that ranges from pH 2 at the luminal surface to nearly neutral pH at the epithelial cell surface, so entry into the gastric mucus layer is important  for H. pylori to escape extremely low pH		VF0051	Motility

The activated HP-NAP receptor also stimulates a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K) activity. The rise in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and the activity of PI3K leads to the activation of renaturable kinases that phosphorylated the cytosolic subunits of the NADPH oxidase of phagocytes, causing their migration to the plasam membrane. Together with the Rac-1 and Rac-2 GTPases, they activate the oxidase activity with production of superoxide anions and reactive oxygen intermediates(RIOs).	VF0052	Proinflammatory effect
Lewis antigen		Helicobacter	Pylori	26695			The O-chain region of LPS express Lewis antigen that are also expressed in the gastric mucosa of humans.

LPS		Helicobacter	Pylori	26695		Under-phosphorylation and under-acylation of lipid A compared with enterobacterial lipid A; the average length of the fatty acid chains in H. pylori lipid A is longer (16 to 18 carbons) than in E. coli (12 to 14 carbons)	H. pylori LPS have much lower immunobiological activities than enterobacterial LPS, thus may prolong H. pylori infection for longer; mediates a lectin-like interaction with laminin, the binding may disrupt epithelial cell-basement membrane interactions contributing to the disruption of gastric mucosal integrity and the development of gastric leakiness associated with the bacterium		VF0056	Endotoxin; Low toxicity; Adherence
OipA	Outer inflammatory protein	Helicobacter	Pylori	26695	H. pylor-related gastritis is characterized by mucosal infiltration with neutrophils and mononuclear cells. The migration and activation of these cells is thought to be ralted to the local production of various proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-8. The presence of a functional cag PAI is associated with increased IL-8 production. But it is not the sole H. pylori factor able to promote IL-8 secretion; regulated by slipped-strand repair mechanism (CT dinucleotide repeats in oipA gene)		Involved in IL-8 production	Recent research indicates that OipA and the cag PAI are both necessary for full activation of the IL-8 promoter but act via different pathways that diverge upstream of IRF-1 where only OipA is involved in the STAT1-IRF1-ISRE pathway. The mucosal inflammatory response to H. pylori infection is complex and involves different pathways converging on the IL-8 promoter	VF0266	Proinflammatory effect

This interaction triggers CagA delivery into target cells as well as activation of focal adhesion kinase and Src.	VF0060	Secretion system; Type IV secretion system; Proinflammatory effect
Urease		Helicobacter	Pylori	26695		~550kDa nickel metalloenzyme comprised of two distinct subunits-UreA and UreB, the UreEFGH proteins are required for activation of urease by incorporating nickel ions into the urease apoenzyme, UreI functions as an acid-dependent urea channel; PDB code: 1E9Z	An important colonization factor, contributes to acid resistance, epithelial cell damage, chemotactic behaviour, and nitrogen metabolism	A Ni2+-containing enzyme, catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to ammonium and carbon dioxide. Urea channels (UreI) present in the inner membrane are opened at pH<6.5, allowing delivery of urea to urease. The ammonia produced diffuses into, and thus buffers the periplasm.	VF0050	Enzyme; Acid resistance; Colonization
VacA	Vacuolating cytotoxin A	Helicobacter	Pylori	26695	VacA expression is determind by variation in the signal sequence (s1a, s1b, s1c, s2) and mid-region (</i>m1, m2</i>) of the vacA gene. s1-type signalling-sequence allele produce functional VacA toxin, whereas s2-type produce VacA with little cytotoxic activity. And s1/m1 strains are more toxic than s1/m2 strains	Proteolytic cleavage of the VacA protoxin (140 kDa) at its N and C termini yields a 33-aa signal sequence, a mature 90-kDa secreted protein, and a C-terminal fragment that remains localized in the bacterial cell; the secreted protein is structured in two distinct parts. First, amino-terminal 37-kDa region,  rich in <beta>-pleated sheets. This region begins with a 32-residue hydrophobic segment with a propensity to insert into membranes, and ends with a protease-sensitive segement. Second, the following 58-kDa part is predicted to consist of two domains, separated by a flexible segment of variable length: the first domain is highly conserved, whereas the second one is genetically considerably diverse.		The secreted VacA toxin oligomerized into resettes. It binds to the apical portion of epithelial cells and inserts into the plasma membrane, forming a hexameric anion-selective channel of low conductance. These channels are release bicarbonate and organic anions from the cell cytosol to support bacterial growth. The toxin channels are slowly endocyosed and eventually reach late endosomal compartment, increasing their permeability to anions with enhancements of the electrogenic vacular ATPase(vATPase)proton pump. In the presence of weak bases, including the ammonia generated by the Helicobacter pylori urease, osmotically active acidotropic ions will accumulate in the endosomes. This leads to water influx and vesicle swelling, and essential step in vacuole formation. By an as-yet-unidentified mechanism, the VacA toxin alters tight junctions and increases the paracellular route of permeability providing iron, nickel and other nutrients, this TER(trans-epithelial resistance) effect of VacA could be mediated through specific interaction with the recently identified cytosolic protein VIP54.; VacA is the first bacterial virulence factor that exploits the important plasma membrane sphingolipid, sphingomyelin (SM), as a cellular receptor.

Dot/Icm	Defect in organella trafficking/intracellular multiplication	Legionella	Pneumophila		14 genes share detecable homology to the tra/trb genes of col1b-P9 plasmid, a member of the IncI class of conjugal plasmids; the second type IV secretion apparatus lvh(Legionella vir homologs) system is poorly characterized. Its 11 genes are located on a genomic-island-like region. It might play a role in the efficiency of host cell infection by L. pneumophila grown at lower temperatures. However, the specific substrates of this system have not yet been identified.	Majority of the dot/icm genes are predicted to encode membrane-associated proteins;DotA is an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein with 8 membrane-spanning domians; IcmK and IcmB proteins are on bacterial surface; IcmQ, IcmS, IcmR, IcmW located in the bacterial cytoplasm;IcmS, IcmW, IvgA are chaperons;  IcmX are periplasmic protein; RalF structure: 1XSZ	Allows survival and growth in macrophages, prevent phagosome acifidication and lysosome fusion, essential for induction of apoptosis in human macrophages	Assemble and activate a type IV secretion system in the bacterial membrane that exports plasmid and virulence factors to inhibit the phago-lysosome fusion and reprogram the Legionella-bearing vacuole; IcmS was shown to bind members of the SidE family (SidE, SdeA, SdeB, SdeC) and to be required for the export of SdeA; IcmW interacted with and was required for the translocation of additional Dot/Icm substrates, including SidG, SidH, WipA and WipB; LvgA directly interacts with IcmS; Dot/Icm secretion substrates have been identified:;<spacer>DotA, a protein that was originally reported to assemble as a polytopic protein in the inner membrane of L. pneumophila cells.

DrrA has the intrinsic ability to bind to the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane. Because the L. pneumophila-containing vacuole (LCV is) initially a plasma-membrane-derived organelle, translocated DrrA protein associates with the immature LCV formed on bacterial internalization. The GDF activity of DrrA promotes the sampling of cytosolic Rab proteins associated with Rab GDI. When Rab1-Rab-GDI complexes are sampled, the removal of Rab GDI permits the GEF domain in DrrA to activate Rab1, leading to the stable association of Rab1 with the LCV membrane. Active Rab1 facilitates organization of the LCV membrane to promote the delivery and fusion of ER-derived vesicles. DrrA cycles off because the composition of the vacuole membrane changes.;<spacer>LepB is a Rab1-specific GAP (GTPase-activating proteins). The LepB protein accumulates on the LCV membrane and the GAP activity facilitates the removal of Rab1 by stimulating GTP hydrolysis. The removal of Rab1 coincides with fusion of the LCV with the host ER and replication of L. pneumophila in a vacuole containing ER proteins.;<spacer>Other candidate effector proteins including SidA-G (substrate of Dot/Icm transporter), Vips (VPS(vacuole protein sorting) inhibitor proteins, VipA, VipD, VipE, VipF), SdeA-D, YlfAB (yeast lethal factor A and B), their real function are unknown; Once the vacuole provides conditions for the bacteria to grow, functional genes of the dot/icm family become dispensable	VF0156	Secretion system; Type IV secretion system

Opa	Opacity-associated	Neisseria	Meningitidis	MC58	Opa proteins were originally identified becasue their expression changes the color and opacity of colonies. The effect may be due to an increased interbacterial aggregation that results from the lectin-like ability of Opa proteins to bind to LOS on adjacent bacteria; A single gonococcal strain can harbour up to 12 opa genes, meningococci usually encode 3 to 4 Opa proteins; all opa genes sequenced to date contain 5' tandem repeats [CTCTT]n that cause high-frequency phase variable expression; grouped into two major classes according to the binding specificity for human surface receptors: the OpaHS-type(heparansulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) and OpaCEA-type (carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or related molecules)	Eight membrane-spanning domains arranged as anti-parallel <beta>-strands to form membrane-embedded <beta> barrel with four extracellular loops, the central two loops termed as 'hypervariable domain 1'(HV-1) and 2(HV-2) are responsible for interactions with different receptors on human cells	The arrangement and number of positively charged amino acids in HV-1 of OpaHS recogize the glycosaminoglycan sidechains of HSPGs. This contact stimulate the activity of PC-PLC and ASM (acid sphinogomyelinase), which results in the generation of the second messagers diacylgycerol and ceramide, respectively; transmembrane syndecan-type HSPGs seem to connect to conventional PKCs regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements that lead to bacterial engulfment; OpaHS is also able to bind extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (vitronectin and fibronectin) as bridging molecules to interact with integrins indirectly, inducing integrin-mediated uptake into epithelial cells; OpaCEA proteins mediates attachment to members of the CEA-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAMs) family that harbour the CD66 epitope. Binding to CEACAMs on polymorphonuclear granulocytes results in opsonin-independent phagocytosis accompanied by activation of ASM, Scr-family kinases, Rac and serine/theronine kinases p21-activated kinase (PAK) and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase(JNK). Binding to CEACAMs on epithelial cells results in rearrangements of actin cytoskeleton and subsequent internalization. In polarized epithelia, this process takes place at the apical surface and can lead via transcytosis to the release of the bacteria at the basolateral side. In T cells,  binding to OpaCEA inhibits T-cell proliferation and activation, presumably by recruting the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and SHP-2		VF0076	Invasion; Phase variation; Beta barrel protein

Porin		Neisseria	Meningitidis	MC58	N.meningitidis produces two porins, PorA and PorB, N.gonorrhoeae expresses only one porin, PorB		Translocate spontaneously as functional voltage-gated ion channels into plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells, causing a transient change in membrane potential and interference with cell signalling; effect the maturation of phagosomes by inhibiting the fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes; the gonococcal PorB1a porin was shown to promote bacterial invasiveness in an Opa- background	The binding to CD66 via Opa induces uptake into a phagosome and, on the other hand, induces an oxidative reaction. The activation of membrane-associated NADPH oxidase leads to production of superoxide anions (O2-), which in the presence of superoxide dismutase are converted into H2O2. The fusion of lysosomal vesicles with the plasma and phagosomal membranes causes a release of myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme that in the presence of H2O2 produces hypochlorite which exhibits a highly toxic potential toward pathogens.Porin prevents the vesicle fusion by insertion into the phagosomal membrane, so MPO discharges into the extracellular milieu, eventually depleting the entire secondary granula from the cell so that the bacteria can safely accommodate within the phagosome.

Type IV pili		Neisseria	Meningitidis	MC58	One or two different loci are used for the expression of the major pilin encoding gene (pilE), whereas various silent genes (pilS) are spread throughout the chromosome.

The pilin monomer contains a C-terminal globular head region and an N-terminal hydrophobic tail that folds into an unusually long <alpha>-helix. Pilin subunits polymerize into a right-handed helical cylinder. The hydrophobic pilin tails pack into the cylinder core while the globular pilin heads face outward, forming the surface of the cylinder;PilT, a cytoplasmic or inner membrane-localized ATPase mediates pilus disassembly from fiber base, causing retraction; PilC acts as an inhibitor of PilT-mediated fiber disassembly	Necessary for initial attachment, twitching motility and competence for natural transformation and autoagglutination	The membrane co-factor protein(MCP or CD46) has been proposed as a cellular receptor for pilus of both pathogenic Neisseria. CD46 is a transmembrane C3b/C4b-binding glycoprotein which functions to control the activation state and deposition of complement, and thereby protects host cells from damage caused by the human complement system	VF0075	Adherence; Phase variation

If this mechanism fails to function properly, abnormally high bacterial carriage would promote the establishment of chronic bacterial infection	Binding interaction occurs between the first extracellular loop of CFTR (predicted to be in amino acids 108-117 of the mature protein) and the complete outer portion of the core polysaccharide of the LPS	VF0085	Adherence; Endotoxin

YaxAB		Yersinia	Enterocolitica	8081	Both YaxA and YaxB are required for cytotoxic activity	Structural homology of YaxA are pore-forming toxins HblB (from Bacillus cereus) and HlyE (from E. coli)	YaxAB-mediated cell death occurs via osmotic lysis through the formation of distinct membrane pores		VF0511	Toxin; Pore-forming toxin
Yersiniabactin		Yersinia	Pestis	CO92	One of the major differences between low- and high-pathogenicity Yersinia lies in their ability to capture the iron molecules necessary for their systemic dissemination in the host	Yeriniabactin belongs to a small sub-group of phenolate siderophores and has an affinity for ferric iron (KD=4 x 10-36) much higher than for ferrous iron.	FyuA/Psn-Irp system uses yersiniabactin, a siderophore that can remove iron from a number of mammalian proteins, due to its extremely high affinity for ferric iron	YbtA is an AraC-like regulator required for transcription of fyuA/psn, irp2 and ybtP, also downregulate its own transcription; In the presence of iron, Fur, a cytosolic protein that on binding ferrous iron changes conformation and binds DNA at a specific site called a Fur box, thus preventing transcription, downregulates transcription of fyuA/psn, irp2 and other iron-regulated genes	VF0136	Iron uptake; Siderophore
Ymt	Yersinia murine toxin	Yersinia	Pestis	CO92	Virulence factors unique to Y. pestis; belongs to a family of phospholipase D enzymes, characterized by conserved HKD (HXKX4DX6GG/S, X: any amino acid) catalytic motifs		Intracellular phospholipase D activity appeared to protect Y. pestis from a cytotoxic digestion product of blood plasma in the flea gut		VF0137	Toxin
Yst		Yersinia	Pestis	CO92	A low-molecular-mass, heat-stable enterotoxin, characteristic only of the virulent strains of Y. enterocolitica; structurally and functionally homologous to the heat-stable enterotoxin of ETEC		Important in causing Yersinia-associated diarrhoea	Stimulate cGMP synthesis in the intestinal brush border, leading to an overall effect of fluid loss and lack of fluid absorption	VF0135	Toxin; Membrane-acting; Guanylate cyclase
